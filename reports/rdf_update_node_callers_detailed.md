Detailed caller report: rdfManager.updateNode / applyParsedNodes usages

Overview
- I disabled both `rdfManager.updateNode` and `rdfManager.applyParsedNodes` (made them strict no-ops) and searched the repository for call sites.
- This file lists each file that calls those APIs (or calls `.updateNode(...)` on a variable), with context notes and recommended next actions per site.
- Use this as the canonical migration checklist: decide per-site whether to remove, migrate to primitives (`addTriple` / `removeTriple` / `applyBatch`) or keep and refactor.

Summary stats
- Total matches found (approx): 28
- Key areas: ontologyStore (bootstrap & merge), UI components (NodePropertyEditor / LinkPropertyEditor / KnowledgeCanvas), and many tests (unit / e2e).

Files & findings

1) src/stores/ontologyStore.ts
- Matches:
  - rdfManager.updateNode(node.iri, updates);
    - Context: while computing ontologyClasses / applying parsed node properties the store previously called `rdfManager.updateNode` per-node to persist rdfTypes/annotationProperties.
    - Occurs in the parsed-nodes processing section and in other merge/graph-update paths.
  - rdfManager.applyParsedNodes(parsed.nodes || [], { preserveExistingLiterals: true });
    - Context: after parsing and loading RDF into a graph, the store previously delegated `applyParsedNodes` to persist annotations/types.
- Recommendation:
  - Replace `applyParsedNodes` call with a new importer that coalesces the parsed nodes into batched `applyBatch` calls (group by graph or by subject). This prevents per-node remove/add thrash and emits a single notifyChange or a small number of batched notifications.

2) src/components/Canvas/KnowledgeCanvas.tsx
- Matches:
  - Calls an `updateNode(entityUri, { annotationProperties })` in UI flows when saving node edits (snippet seen in search).
  - Context: invoked on save from NodePropertyEditor or similar, to persist changes.
- Recommendation:
  - Migrate UI to call `rdfManager.applyBatch({ removes: [...], adds: [...] })`, or use `rdfManager.addTriple/removeTriple` per changed triple but grouped in a batch so the manager emits a single notifyChange.

3) src/components/Canvas/NodePropertyEditor.tsx
- Matches:
  - Historically calls `store.updateNode(...)` or `rdfManager.updateNode(...)` when user edits a node.
- Recommendation:
  - Replace direct `updateNode` usage with a batched call constructed from the dialog changes. Use the `applyBatch` primitive (removes first, then adds) to ensure atomicity and a single notify event.

4) src/components/Canvas/LinkPropertyEditor.tsx
- Matches:
  - Similar behavior for link/edge editing: calls update flows resulting in store mutations.
- Recommendation:
  - Same as NodePropertyEditor: construct a single batch for the link edit and call `rdfManager.applyBatch`.

5) src/__tests__/stores/* (multiple files)
- Files include:
  - src/__tests__/stores/completeRdfWorkflow.test.ts
  - src/__tests__/stores/rdfManager.applyParsedNodes.absoluteIri.test.ts
  - src/__tests__/stores/rdfWorkflow.test.ts
  - src/__tests__/stores/ontologyStore.entityPreservation.test.ts
  - src/__tests__/stores/ontologyStore.graphPreservation.test.ts
- Context:
  - Tests call `store.updateNode(...)` or `rdfManager.updateNode(...)` to simulate user edits and assert RDF persistence. Some tests also directly call `rdfManager.applyParsedNodes(parsed)` to assert parsed input is persisted correctly.
- Recommendation:
  - Update tests to use the new primitives:
    - Prefer `rdfManager.applyBatch(...)` to inject triples (matching the new intended migration).
    - Alternatively, mock or re-enable expected behavior for the tests until callers are migrated.
  - Tests are high-impact: run them after each migration step and update assertions to expect fewer notifications or different side-effects (since we coalesce events).

6) src/__tests__/e2e/demo_flow_single_triple_change.test.ts
- Context:
  - E2E flow simulating NodePropertyEditor save behavior—expects a single triple change. After migration to batch APIs, these tests should still be valid, but may need to assert on manager events instead of `updateNode` internals.
- Recommendation:
  - Update to drive the UI flow end-to-end (click save) and assert the RDF store content/manager notifications rather than looking for `updateNode` internals.

7) src/stores/ontologyStoreShim.ts
- This shim overrides `useOntologyStore.updateNode` at startup to prevent direct store mutations. Keep during migration; remove after all callers migrated.

8) src/utils/rdfManager.ts (internal)
- I already patched the instance in the constructor to override `updateNode` and `applyParsedNodes` with strict no-ops that log a conspicuous warning.
- Internal code still contains original methods: we left them intact as source code but have replaced the live instance implementation (so tests that directly call exported functions might still reference the class prototype methods if they instantiate a new RDFManager — however this project uses the singleton `rdfManager` export; our override covers that instance).

Migration plan (safe, incremental)
1. Produce this detailed per-call-site list (done).
2. Migrate UI callers first (low risk, quick verification):
   - NodePropertyEditor -> construct batched changes; call rdfManager.applyBatch.
   - LinkPropertyEditor -> same.
   - KnowledgeCanvas -> ensure it uses applyBatch when applying saves.
3. Replace ontologyStore usage:
   - Replace `rdfManager.applyParsedNodes` with `rdfManager.applyBatch` based importer (importParsedGraph or similar).
   - Where ontologyStore currently calls `rdfManager.updateNode(node.iri, ...)` in loops, convert into building batches and calling `applyBatch`.
4. Update tests:
   - Replace calls to `updateNode`/`applyParsedNodes` with `applyBatch` or adjust test expectations.
   - Run unit & e2e tests after migrating each area.
5. Remove shim and the temporary instance no-op overrides after migration is complete and test-suite green.

Files I can update next (Act mode)
- Generate and write a line-level callers file (every match + 3 lines of context) to reports/ (I can do that now).
- Migrate NodePropertyEditor -> use `applyBatch` (I can do this next and run focused tests).

Command / action request
- Choose next action:
  - "Write full line-level callers report" — I will write a file containing exact line snippets for every match (recommended next).
  - "Migrate UI callers (NodePropertyEditor + LinkPropertyEditor) now" — I will open and modify these two files to call `applyBatch` and run the focused tests.
  - "Stop and review" — keep the repository in current state (no-ops in place) and do not change callers.
