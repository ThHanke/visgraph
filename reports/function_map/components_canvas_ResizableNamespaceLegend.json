    "type": "React.FC",
    "description": "Interactive draggable and resizable legend showing registered namespace prefixes with colors. Reads namespaces from rdfManager, computes a palette map, allows dragging/resizing, and shows a scrollable list of prefixes and URIs."
  },
  "behaviors": [
    "Initializes position/size based on window dimensions and namespace count.",
    "Builds a paletteMap using buildPaletteMap for consistent color assignment with canvas.",
    "Provides drag and resize interactions via mouse events; uses onClose prop to close.",
    "Optimizes rendering by filtering out empty prefixes and sorting entries."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "UI-focused. Palette building and namespace normalization logic duplicates other palette helpers; consider centralizing palette utilities.",
    "Interaction logic (drag/resize) is specific to this component and is appropriate here."
  ]
}
